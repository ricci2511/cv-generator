# CV Generator

Web App to build your own CV with dynamic rendering, meaning there is a preview
section that is changing as you are building your resume. The final result can be 
exported to a PDF file.

My first ever React project and first time using Material UI. Built with class components
to get familiar with them. Will probably soon rewrite the app to use React Hooks.

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/ricci2511/cv-generator.git
cd cv-generator
npm install
npm start
```
